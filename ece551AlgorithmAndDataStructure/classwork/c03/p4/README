Classwork 3: Problem 4
----------------------
For this problem, you will be writing a function which,
given an integer n, computes the prime factorization of n.
The prime factorization of a number is the list of all of the
prime numbers which multiply together to make that number.
For example, given an input of 12, this function should print out
2 * 2 * 3
since 12 is equal to 2 * 2 * 3, and both 2 and 3 are prime numbers.

For 1, your program should print an empty line, since it is the product
of zero primes. 
For numbers less than 1, your program should behave sanely, but exactly
how it behaves is up to you.

 1. Edit the file pfact.c, which already provides a main to test with.
    Fill in the function 
      void printFactors(int n) 
    to compute the prime factorization as described above.
    Note that the function should print " * " between factors,
    but should not have an extra "*" at the start or end of the line.
    
 2. Compile with the provided Makefile, and test by comparing
    your program's output to pfactans.txt

 3. Commit your modified pfact.c with git.
