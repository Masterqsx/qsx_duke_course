Classwork 3: Problem 3
----------------------
For this problem, you will be writing a program to compute the Nth
Fibonacci number.  The 0th Fibonacci number is 0, the 1st is 1,
the 2nd is also 1, and in general the Nth is the sum of the previous
two.

 1. Create a file "fib.txt".
 2. In your "fib.txt" file, do steps 1 through 4 of this problem.
    For step 1, try it with N = 5.  (Of course, feel free to do more
    if needed)
    For step 4, try it with N = 6.  
    Note any corner cases you think of.

 3. Create a file "fib.c"
 4. Write the function
     int fib (int n)
    in your fib.c file, so that it implements the algorithm
    you came up with.
 5. Write a main function in fib.c which tests your fib function
    on all values from -2 to 30 (inclusive on both ends).
    For each value, it should print a string with the format:
      "fib(%d) = %d\n"
    where the first %d is the number being tested, and the
    second %d is the answer returned by fib.
 6. Compile your program with the provided Makefile,
    and test it by comparing its output to the provided
    fibans.txt output.
 7. Submit fib.txt, and fib.c by adding and commiting
    to git.
