Classwork 3. Problem 2
----------------------

Run the included "guess" program to play my "guessing game" against the comptuer.
You will quickly discover that its pretty difficult to win against this game,
since the computer provides no information to help you refine you guess.

Fortunately for you, you can use gdb to win---which is of course the real point
of this game.  Load the program in gdb, and use the gdb commands you have learned
to step through the program and inspect its variables.  This should allow you
to "win" the game.  

Write down the secret number (one line) and magic words (the next line) in a 
file called "answer.txt".  Note that if your answer.txt is correct, you should
be able to run the program, redirecting input from answer.txt and "win", like so:


ece551@linux:~/classwork/c05/p2$ ./guess < answer.txt
Hello, we are going to play a guessing game!
What number do you guess? Correct!  Now we play another game!
Guess the magic words!
What words do you guess?  Very good (do you know the movie that references?)
