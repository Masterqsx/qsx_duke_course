Classwork 5: Problem 4
----------------------

 1. Open the provided maxSeq.c file and write
    the function:
      int  maxSeq(int * array, int n);
    which returns the length of the maximum increasing contiguous subsequence
    in the array.  The parameter n specifies the length fo the array  For example,
    if the array passed in were
   
     { 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 9}
  
    this function would return 4 because the longest sequence
    of (strictly) increasing numbers in that array is 1, 3, 5, 7
    which has length 4.  Note that 1,3,5,7,9 is an increasing
    subsequence, but is not contiguous (finding discontiguous 
    ones efficiently takes techniques we haven't learned yet).


 2. Compile and test your code. 
    We have provided a main function which will print test cases
    and your function's answer for them. You should get
    6, 7, 6, 1, 0, 0.

 3. Commit to git
     

Hint:
  Can you abstract a complex step out into a simple function?
