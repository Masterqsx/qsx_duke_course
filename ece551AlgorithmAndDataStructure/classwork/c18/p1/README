Classwork 18, The whole thing: file de-duplication.
===================================================

For this classwork, you are going to write a file de-dupliation program.
A de-duplication program searches through a set of directories, and removes
files which are exactly identical to other files.  However, to reduce
the risk of catastrophe as you test this program, you are not actually
going to remove the files, but instead, print a shell script which would
remove the files if you ran it.

*DO NOT ACTUALLY REMOVE THE DUPLICATED FILES*

Your program has the following requirements:


 - It must take as command line arguments 1 or more directory names, find all
   regular files (recursively) contained within those directories, and find
   duplicates to remove.

 - As your program's output is a shell script, it should first print
   #!/bin/bash

 - Whenever your program find a duplicated file, it must print lines of
   a shell script to standard output.  First, it must print a comment
   indicating what file it is removing, and what file
   it is a duplicate of, then it should print an "rm" command which would remove
   the file.   The program should print this output using
   the full pathnames of the files.  For example:

   #Removing /home/ece551/test/file1 (duplicate of /home/ece551/test/dir1/file2).
   rm /home/ece551/test/file1

   Your script should have exactly the same format.

 - Of the identical files, you may remove any of the copies, as long as you leave
   one of them.

 - Your program must work correctly in the prescense of multiple copies
   of the same file (so if file1, file2, file3, and file4 are the same,
   your program must delete 3 of them and leave---however, it is considered
   correct whichever one you leave).

 - Your program should ignore symlinks, as they do not actually represent
   another copy of the data.

 - Your program may NOT perform an N^2 comparison of all of the files (checking
   every file's contents against every other file's contents).  Instead, you must
   use a hashtable, in which you hash the contents of the files, and only
   compare files which have the same hash.
   You can expect that we may test on a large number of largish files, and
   will require your program to complete in a reasonable time.

 - You may assume that the contents of the directories/files will not change
   while your program runs (unless you change them).


At this point, you have had enough experience working on moderately sized programming
problems that we are not going to hold your hand and walk you through how to
break this down into reasonably sized pieces, and incrementally test.  Instead,
we are simply going to expect that you use what you have learned in this class
to write the program yourself.  

This program may require library functions and system calls that you
are likely unfamiliar with.  We expect that you have the skills to
find them and read their documentation by this point.

Ultimately, you should provide a Makefile which compiles your program for
us into a binary called deduplicate.  As always, your program should valgrind
cleanly, and be resilient to error conditions.
